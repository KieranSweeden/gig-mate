# Bugs

## Fixed Bugs

1. Navbar dropdown appearing behind main content
    - When clicking on the hamburger icon to open the dropdown navbar menu, the menu would appear behind the main content on the page.
    - This was promptly solved by addressing the z-index of the element with the class of "navbar-collapse". Giving this element the z-index value of 1 meant the dropdown would always appear above the content underneath the navbar.
    ```
    .navbar-collapse {
        z-index: 1;
        background-color: var(--gigmate-white);
    }
    ```
2. Navbar moving upwards when uncollapsing the dropdown menu
    - When clicking on the hamburger icon, the dropdown navigation menu would appear and push the navbar upwards, making the navbar appear broken.
    - This was solved by giving the container within the navbar a positional value of fixed with adjustments to centre the navigation, with the parent having a positional value of relative.
    - Although this is appropriate for mobile & tablet screen sizes, it negatively affected the desktop navbar design. To counteract this, I applied these changes within a media query for screen sizes below 992px.
    ```
    @media (max-width: 992px) {
        .navbar-collapse {
        position: absolute;
        top: 100%;
        left: 0;
        right: 0;
        }
    }
    ```
3. Container not scrolling when using overflow:scroll
    - Despite applying the value of scroll to the property of overflow that's attached to a container filled with content, the container was not scrolling.
    - After viewing [this Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17295219/overflow-scroll-css-is-not-working-in-the-div) and reading [Ionic캒 Biz캒u](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1420197/ionic%c4%83-biz%c4%83u)'s answer, I recognised this was because the container I was attempting to add a scroll functionality did not have a declared height. After adding a height property & value, this issue was resolved.
    ```
    .rep-container section {
    height: 72.5vh;
    overflow: scroll;
    }
    ```
4. Scrollbar moving content within container, resulting in an asymmetrical design
    - Although the scrollbar functionality worked as intended, it took up space within the container which pushed the content to the left, resulting in an asymmetrical design which wasn't intended.
    - After viewing [this Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24671317/scrollbar-above-content?rq=1) and reading [Forex](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1384493/forex)'s answer, I realised that instead of scroll, the value of overflow needed to be overlay, which adds scroll functionality and renders the scrollbar above the content rather than within.
    ```
    .rep-container section {
    height: 72.5vh;
    overflow: overlay;
    }
    ```
