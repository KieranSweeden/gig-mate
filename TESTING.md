# Bugs

1. Navbar dropdown appearing behind main content
    - When clicking on the hamburger icon to open the dropdown navbar menu, the menu would appear behind the main content on the page.
    - This was promptly solved by addressing the z-index of the element with the class of "navbar-collapse". Giving this element the z-index value of 1 meant the dropdown would always appear above the content underneath the navbar.
    ```
    .navbar-collapse {
        z-index: 1;
        background-color: var(--gigmate-white);
    }
    ```
