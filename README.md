## User Stories

### Professional Musician Stories

As a professional musician, I want GigMate to:
- Provide me a template document structure, that I can easily edit for each gig respectively.
- Function on multiple screens, so I can view/edit gig information at home on desktop, on the go on mobile and whilst performing on tablet/mobile.
- Save the edits I make, so they'll always be there when I re-visit them on that particular device.
- Have an interface that's simple to use, that's consistent across multiple devices.

### Client Stories

As a client looking to book a singer/band, I want GigMate to:
- Present me with the set list of a particular singer/band, giving me the functionality to create a new setlist for my event from the original setlist written by the singer/band.
- Filter through a setlist by track and artist name, enabling me to quickly query whether a band knows a song or songs by a particular artist.
- Allow me to drag and drop tracks up & down, to create a structure of tracks I'm happy with.
