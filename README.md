# UX

## Strategy

### Project Goals

The primary goal of GigMate, is to provide it's users with an elegant and simple way of organising & structuring information relevant to events they're either organising or providing a service within.

### User Stories

As a professional musician, I want GigMate to:
- Provide me a template document structure, that I can easily edit for each gig respectively.
- Function on multiple screens, so I can view/edit gig information at home on desktop, on the go on mobile and whilst performing on tablet/mobile.
- Save the edits I make, so they'll always be there when I re-visit them on that particular device.
- Have an interface that's simple to use, that's consistent across multiple devices.
